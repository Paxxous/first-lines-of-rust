// the main function 
fn main() {
    // This is literally pretty much just arrays in other languages lmao
    let array = [1, 2, 3, 4,5, 6, 7, 8]; // This is a known value in the heap. so it can be easily accessed.

    // Loop through it, I kind of like the simplicity that these for loops bring to the table (like python!)
    for i in array {
        println!("{}", i);
    }
