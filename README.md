# My first lines of Rust

A git repo that dates back to some of my first ever Rust programs.

## Thoughts on Rust

I love compiled languages, and when messing around with Rust, it's hard to say it's a bad language.

I like the modern approach that's been taken with this language, and I'm excited to learn more.

I've seen that Rust has a lot of potential, and I hope to do a lot with the language, I love its thorough documentation and great selection of libraries. It's the perfect mix of Python and C++ that I've needed.
